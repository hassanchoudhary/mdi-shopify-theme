For ten years, my crop was harvested by the co-operative at Coustellet. In this time, I was lucky to meet Denis Langue, an expert winemaker. I was curious to see what my vines were producing after 17 years of maturing in the Oppède soil and sun.<\/p><p>Denis’ comment and verdict were; “Promising grapes, you should consider producing your own label.” Soon thereafter we arranged to make the wine with Cave de Lumières, only 3 kilometers from the house, and I became a bona fide vintner.<\/p>",
