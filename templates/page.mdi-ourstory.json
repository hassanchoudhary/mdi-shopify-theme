For ten years, my crop was harvested by the co-operative at Coustellet. In this time, I was lucky to meet Denis Langue, an expert winemaker. I was curious to see what my vines were producing after 17 years of maturing in the Oppède soil and sun.<\/p><p>Denis’ comment and verdict were; “Promising grapes, you should consider producing your own label.” Soon thereafter we arranged to make the wine with Cave de Lumières, only 3 kilometers from the house, and I became a bona fide vintner.<\/p>",
        "des_body_right": "<p>By 2012 we were awarded a Gold Medal at the Paris “Concours General Agricole,” a Silver medal in 2015, and again, another Gold in 2016.<\/p><p>Clearly, it was time to consider building a Cave in the Oppède vineyard. In 2017 it was designed with the help of a local architect, Andrew Corpe from Bonnieux — an Englishman who has been working in Provence for over 30 years. We broke ground in late 2018, it will be completed by late 2020.<\/p><p>In the 25 years I have been visiting this magical area, it has become an important place for me with its rich history — In 2009 I made a film there celebrating my love for the district and the French way of life, “A Good Year”. The silence and sunshine are a sanctuary from my profession — filming is noisy, and stress filled, but it is my passion, and I live it. I love to come here and paint, read, write and, hopefully, improve my corner of Provence.<\/p><p><em>I hope you enjoy our wine!<\/em><\/p>",
